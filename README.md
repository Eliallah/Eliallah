## Hi there 👋
I'm Eliallah (eh-lee-AH-lah) -  a Ghanaian American who's equally obsessed with tech and the everyday things that keep me grounded: long runs, a good makeup routine, and hosting people I love. Those moments remind me that while I'm super ambitious, I'm also human.

At my core, I'm a thinker. I'm passionate about solving problems, understanding the why and how behind how systems work, and creating tools that blend creativity and real-world impact.

## 
My Goals
Strengthen my skills in software development and data analysis
Contribute to projects that help small businesses and underrepresented communities
Build a clean professional portfolio that reflects who I am
